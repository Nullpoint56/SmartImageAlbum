# Tooling Justification for Image Processing Platform

This document outlines and justifies the selection of deployable services used in the Image Processing Platform. The
choices reflect the system's requirements for scalability, cloud-native architecture, and maintainability, as detailed
in the [Architecture Documentation](./architecture_documentation.md) and project requirements.

## 1. Vector Store: **Qdrant**

### ‚úÖ Justification

* **Purpose**: Stores high-dimensional vector embeddings and supports similarity search queries.
* **Selected Tool**: [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech)

### üîç Why Qdrant?

* **Performance**: Optimized for dense vector search with support for ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) techniques.
* **API Support**: Provides both REST and gRPC APIs for flexible integration.
* **Filtering Support**: Can store metadata alongside vectors and filter search results based on attributes.
* **Ease of Use**: Actively maintained with a strong Python SDK.
* **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable and container-friendly for Kubernetes or Docker environments.

### üîÑ Alternatives Considered

* **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Simpler integration, but limited performance and scalability + harder to set up
* **Weaviate**: Powerful, but heavier and less flexible in self-hosted environments.

---

## 2. Object Store: **MinIO**

### ‚úÖ Justification

* **Purpose**: Stores raw image files and supports efficient retrieval via the Coordinator.
* **Selected Tool**: [MinIO](https://min.io)

### üîç Why MinIO?

* **S3 Compatibility**: Fully S3-compatible, allowing seamless migration to AWS if needed.
* **Self-hosted Option**: Ideal for development, testing, and privacy-aware production setups.
* **Scalability**: Supports distributed mode for high availability.
* **Simplicity**: Lightweight, easy to deploy, and integrates well with Python (`boto3` or `minio` clients).

### üîÑ Alternatives Considered

* **AWS S3 / GCP Storage / Azure Blob**: Suitable for production, but incur vendor lock-in and external dependency.

---

## 3. Embedding Service: **Custom FastAPI Service using Hugging Face Transformers**

### ‚úÖ Justification

* **Purpose**: Transforms images into high-dimensional embeddings using pretrained vision models.
* **Selected Tool**: Custom FastAPI service using the [Hugging Face
  `transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) library.

### üîç Why Hugging Face Transformers?

* **Model Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of vision models including OpenCLIP, DINOv2, SigLIP, and more.
* **Unified Interface**: Consistent API for encoding images across different model types.
* **Self-Hosted**: Fully open-source and Dockerizable for private or cloud deployment.
* **Production-Ready**: Integrates easily with FastAPI for lightweight embedding-as-a-service.
* **Extensibility**: Future support for additional models and embedding tasks.

### üîÑ Alternatives Considered

* **CLIP-as-a-Service (Jina)**: Too heavy and unmaintained; designed for multimodal search and dataset indexing.
* **Custom OpenCLIP-only Service**: Viable but limited to CLIP models alone.

---

## 4. Task Orchestration: **Celery**

### ‚úÖ Justification

* **Purpose**: Manages background task execution and supports long-running and scheduled jobs.
* **Selected Tool**: [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/)

### üîç Why Celery?

* **Scheduling Support**: Native support for periodic tasks (via Celery Beat) allows for time-based workflows without extra tooling.
* **Proven Stability**: Industry-standard task queue system with a large community and track record in production.
* **Retry and Failure Handling**: Rich capabilities for retries, acknowledgments, and task expiration.
* **Observability**: Compatible with tools like Flower for live monitoring, and integrates with Prometheus exporters.
* **Pluggable Backends**: Supports Redis, RabbitMQ, and others as brokers and result stores.

### üîÑ Alternatives Considered

* **Arq**: Lightweight and async-friendly, but lacks built-in scheduling and has more limited ecosystem support.
* **RQ**: Simpler and Pythonic, but less robust for advanced features like retries, prioritization, and monitoring.
* **Temporal**: More powerful, but significantly more complex to set up and manage for current project needs.

Celery offers the right balance between capability and maintainability for our use case. It handles the orchestration of the image processing pipeline reliably while remaining extendable and production-ready.

## Conclusion

The selected tools‚Äî**Qdrant**, **MinIO**, **a custom Hugging Face Transformers-based Embedding Service**, and **Celery**‚Äîalign with our architecture's goals of modularity, async-first processing, and cloud-native deployment. They enable scalable,
containerized development with clean service boundaries and strong observability potential.

Future improvements, such as switching to managed services or integrating a workflow engine like Temporal, can be easily
introduced due to the system's decoupled and service-oriented design.
